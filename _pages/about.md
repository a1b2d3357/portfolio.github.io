I’m a final-year BS CS student (aspiring for Ph.D.) at the [Lahore University of Management and Sciences](https://lums.edu.pk/). My research interests span the domain of privacy and digital safety, focusing on designing secure, trustworthy, and reliable systems. To this end, I have actively engaged in extensive research projects that have resulted in thorough work observing firsthand the risks posed to everyday users by systems that create a false sense of trust and safety unprecedented levels.

Research Experience
======
Since my Sophomore year, I have worked on an extensive research project supervised by [Dr. Ihsan Ayyub Qazi](ihsanqazi.com), investigating the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of misinformation. To approach the problem, we curated an extensive, high-quality dataset of real-world claims and evaluated LLMs using zero-shot, unstructured prompts—a setup designed to reflect a typical layperson's usage, unlike prior studies. Our downstream analysis uncovered several compelling insights, including evidence of regional, multilingual, and psychological biases in LLMs, their potential to propagate misinformation, and areas where improvements are needed across state-of-the-art models. Owing to the scale, originality, and robustness of our findings, we are finalizing a draft for submission to the prestigious journal **[Science](https://www.science.org/)**.

I have also been working under the supervision of [Dr. Zubair Shafiq](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~zubair/) and [Dr. Fareed Zaffar](https://dblp.org/pid/59/3605.html) since my junior year to develop a system that uncovers how websites track user behavior using the Meta Pixel over time. While developers can access public-facing files configuring the Meta Pixel, no prior research has analyzed the minified and obfuscated code these files contain. Leveraging sophisticated crawlers, I detected the presence of the Meta Pixel and retrieved historical configuration files using the [Wayback Machine](https://wayback.archive.org/). I then developed custom parsers using code-diff tools along with a detailed differential analysis to facilitate our understanding of the source code. As a result, I designed a first-of-its-kind public-facing tool, [Pixel Excavator](https://pixel-frontend-1glb.onrender.com/), enabling users to analyze the tracking behaviors of prominent and sensitive websites. As a case study, we are currently analyzing AMA hospital websites. Preliminary findings indicate that while Meta has implemented some restrictions on tracking visitor data on sensitive sites, several loopholes persist. Building on these results, we aim to refine our analysis and submit our work to **[ACM CCS 2025](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/)**. A current draft of the paper can be accesses from [here](/files/pixeldraft.pdf). 

As part of a course project, I recently also worked with [Dr. Masooda Bashir](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/masooda-bashir)'s group, where I conducted a study analyzing over 50,000 user reviews of popular health chatbot applications. Evaluating both BART and Gemini, I identified user sentiments and privacy-intrusive concerns, uncovering novel risks associated with healthchatbots directly felt by users. The research proposed a scalable framework to address these privacy challenges while offering actionable insights to enhance user privacy and data security in AI-driven health applications. The findings are currently under review in the _Symposium on Usable Security and Privacy (USEC) 2025_.

Teaching Experience
======
1. **Data Science**   |   (Fall 2024)
2. **Data Structures**   |   (Spring 2024)
3. **Discrete Mathematics**   |   (Fall 2023)

Adopting the role of a teaching assitant has allowed me to creatively design programming assignments from scratch (e.g.,
on AVL Trees in C++ or Causal Inference in Python), structure comprehensive exams and quizzes, deliver
live tutorials, use code-similarity checkers (JPlag) and supervise semester-long research and application-based
data science projects - all in all solidifying my understanding of the courses in various, unanticipated ways
